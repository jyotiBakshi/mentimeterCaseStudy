CaseStudy.java

In this file, we are first reading the Question API for the question and available labels. Then we search the fetched lables in Result API, to find the respective score.
Last, we show the result(score+label) in ascending order of score.

For ex: 
Result for best Interactive Presentation : {1=Slido, 2=Kahoot, 3=Mentimeter}
